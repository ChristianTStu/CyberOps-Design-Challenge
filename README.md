# CyberOps-Design-Challenge

Welcome to the Cyber Operations Infrastructure Design assignment. This project challenges you to design a theoretical infrastructure for a cyber operations campaign using advanced tools like bots and social engineering. Your design will reflect your understanding of cybersecurity strategies and your ability to architect solutions that balance performance, security, and cost.

## Overview of Cyber Operations

Cyber operations involve complex strategies including command and control servers, botnets, and social engineering. These components work together to infiltrate, manipulate, and control digital environments, often for malicious purposes.

## Tools Required

- **draw.io**: Use this tool to create your infrastructure diagram. Access it at [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/). You can use the web UI or download the app for free, which includes many useful icons for designing.

## Research Phase

1. **Conduct Preliminary Research**:
   - Investigate existing cyber operations that utilize bots and social engineering.
   - Identify the necessary computing, storage, and security components needed for your campaign.
   - Understand the interaction between different elements such as botnets and phishing techniques.

## Design Phase

2. **Create Your Diagram**:
   - Using draw.io, draft a detailed diagram of your cyber operations infrastructure. Include elements like compute instances, networking components (VPCs, subnets), a load balancer, and security measures (security groups, IAM roles).
### Example:

## Data Flow and Defense Mechanisms

3. **Illustrate Data Flow**:
   - Show how commands and information will travel through your designed infrastructure.

4. **Depict Defense Mechanisms**:
   - Design and include defensive strategies to protect against counter-cyber operations.

## Explanation Component

5. **Write a Detailed Explanation**:
   - Alongside your diagram, provide a written explanation (200-400 words) detailing the function of each component and their interrelationships in facilitating a cyber ops campaign. Include aspects of Managed Attribution and strategies like CNA (Computer Network Attack), CND (Computer Network Defense), and CNE (Computer Network Exploitation).

## Presentation and Submission

6. **Finalize Your Presentation**:
   - Ensure your diagram is clear, well-organized, and easy to understand. Use appropriate labels and legends for clarity.

7. **Prepare Your Submission**:
   - Submit your diagram and the written explanation in a PowerPoint slide (or PDF). Include the XML file of your diagram from draw.io.

8. **Ensure Originality**:
   - Make sure your work is original and appropriately cites any sources you consulted.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Accuracy**: How accurately does your design reflect real-world cyber operations infrastructure?
- **Complexity**: Does your diagram demonstrate a deep understanding and complexity of cyber operations?
- **Clarity**: How clear and understandable are your diagram and written explanation?
- **Originality**: Innovation in the design and approach to addressing the problem.

Thank you for participating in this assignment to design a theoretical cyber operations infrastructure. This exercise will enhance your skills in cybersecurity strategy and infrastructure design, preparing you for real-world cyber operations challenges. We look forward to your innovative solutions and a clear demonstration of your understanding of cyber operations.
